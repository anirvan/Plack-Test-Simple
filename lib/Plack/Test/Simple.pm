    use Plack::Test::Simple;

    # prepare test container
    my $t = Plack::Test::Simple->new('/path/to/app.psgi');

    # global request configuration
    my $req = $t->request;
    $req->headers->authorization_basic('h@cker', 's3cret');
    $req->headers->content_type('application/json');

    # standard GET request test
    # automatic JSON serialization if content-body is a hash/array reference
    my $tx = $t->transaction('get', '/search?q=awesomeness', 'content body');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Plack::Test::Simple is a collection of testing helpers for anyone developing
Plack applications. This module is a wrapper around L<Plack::Test> providing a
unified interface to test PSGI applications using L<HTTP::Request> and
L<HTTP::Response> objects. Typically a Plack web application's deployment stack
includes various middlewares and utilities which are now even easier to test
along-side the actual web application code.

sub BUILDARGS {
    my ($class, @args) = @_;

    unshift @args, 'psgi' if $args[0] && !$args[1];
    return {@args};
}

=attribute request

The request attribute contains the L<HTTP::Request> object which will be used
to process the HTTP requests. This attribute is never reset.

=cut

has request => (
    is      => 'rw',
    lazy    => 1,
    builder => 1
);

sub _build_request {
    return HTTP::Request->new(
        uri => URI->new(scheme => 'http', host => 'localhost', path => '/')
    )
}

=attribute psgi

The psgi attribute contains a coderef containing the PSGI compliant application
code or a string containing the path to the psgi file.

=cut

has psgi => (
    is   => 'rw',
);

=method transaction

The transaction method returns a L<Plack::Test::Simple::Transaction> object
containing the HTTP request and response object that will be used to facilitate
the HTTP transaction. The actually HTTP request is deferred until the response
object is needed, this allows you to further modify the transactions HTTP
request object before it is processed. This method optionally accepts an HTTP
request method, a request path (or URI object), and content (any string) you
wish to place in the body of the request. If the content body argument is a
hash/array reference, we will attempt to encode and serialize it automatically
as a JSON object. These parameters are used to further modify the transaction's
request object. Please see L<Plack::Test::Simple::Transaction> for more
information on how to use the transaction object to further automate tests.

    my $tx = $self->transaction('post', '/path/to/resource', 'content body');

        request => $self->request->clone
    );

    $path ||= '/';

    $trans->request->method(uc $meth);

    }

    return $trans;

=method connect_returns_CODE

The connect_returns_CODE method is a shorthand method for returning a
transaction object much like the transaction method except the the actual HTTP

represents any valid HTTP response code, e.g. 200.

        '/path/to/resource', 'content body'
