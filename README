NAME
    Plack::Test::Simple - Object-Oriented PSGI Application Testing

VERSION
    version 0.000001

SYNOPSIS
    Plack::Test::Simple is a collection of testing helpers for anyone
    developing Plack applications. This module is a wrapper around
    Plack::Test, based on the design of Test::Mojo, providing a unified
    interface to test PSGI applications using HTTP::Request and
    HTTP::Response objects. Typically a Plack web application's deployment
    stack includes various middlewares and utilities which are now even
    easier to test along-side the actual web application code.

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::More;
        use Plack::Test::Simple;

        my $t   = Plack::Test::Simple->new('/path/to/app.psgi');
        my $req = $t->request;
        my $res = $t->response;

        # setup
        $req->headers->authorization_basic('h@cker', 's3cret');
        $req->headers->content_type('application/json');

        # text request
        $t->can_get('/search')->status_is(200);

        # json request
        $t->can_post('/search')->status_is(200);
        $t->data_has('/results/4/title');

        done_testing;
